# SportEase

SportEase is a simple website that I designed to ease the process of booking and managing sports fields. The home page features an attractive design with the use of HTML5 and Semantic HTML to ensure a semantic structure. There are also subtle animation effects as users scroll through the page to provide a more interactive experience, as well as a real-time "Favorite" button that allows users to quickly save their favorite fields.

- **HTML5 & Semantic HTML**: Ensures robust structure and semantics on the home page.
- **Engaging Design**: Captivating design to create a stunning visual experience.
- **Animate on Scroll**: Smooth animation effects while scrolling the page for a more interactive experience.
- **Realtime Favorite Button**: Real-time "Favorite" button to quickly save favorite fields.
